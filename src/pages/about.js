              <p>
                    I believe in time management and discipline. I created my first hand-coded webpage in 2016. My approach is simple: to make something, make it fast, make it now, make it by yourself and it is never too late to start doing it. I am like & passionate about fitness, martial arts, drawing and Debian Linux.
